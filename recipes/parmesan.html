        <h1>Chicken Parmesan</h1>
        <p><img src="../images/image-2.webp" alt="" /></p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in
            Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal
            may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home. In fact,
            chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in
            your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of
            Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the
            chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big
            soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that
            way, not with this method.
